	    {
	        Driven technical manager and senior software developer with 9+ years experience in software architecture, design, and development. Skilled at Data Discovery tools and Data mining, having delivered around 10 successful commercial projects in enterprise scale. After graduating in 2010 with a BSc degree in Computer Science \& Software Engineering, I started working at renowned software/IT companies in Iran while in parallel pursuing my own entrepreneurial enthusiasm. In December 2013 I founded my own software tech company, SimiaTec Co., for which I serve as the CEO at the moment. Currently a lecturer at the University of Applied Science \& Technology in Zanjan, Iran, I have additionally gained experience training over 60 personnel for my own company throughout the past 6 years. I learned to work in a team from day one and have experienced the entire spectrum of the team-working from a junior member to a group leader. I am now determined to undertake a PhD as an invaluable experience in independent research.
